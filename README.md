# AreaVolumeShapesCalculator
My very first program which was created in May 2020 through the online IDE replit.com, formerly known as repl.it, (later transferred to PyCharm using Python 3.10)
as a final project for the high school computer science course 'AP Computer Science Principles'.
Program is an Area/Volume of Shapes calculator gives the user the option to calculate the area of a Square, Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, or Trapazoid.
Or the Volume of a Cube, Sphere, Rectangular Prism, Triangular Prism, or Trapazoidal Prism.
